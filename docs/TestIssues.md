# Test Issues Report

## Unit Test Issues

The unit tests are failing with the following errors:

1. `ProgramTests.cs` - Error: `'Program' does not contain a definition for 'CreateRootCommand'`
   - This indicates that the tests are expecting a `CreateRootCommand` method in the Program class that doesn't exist.
   - Solution: Either update the Program.cs file in HealthTracker.Cli to expose this method or update the tests to match the current implementation.

## Integration Test Issues

The integration tests have a warning about nullability in the `DatabaseServiceIntegrationTests.cs`.

## Next Steps

1. Review the CLI implementation in Program.cs
2. Update tests to match the current implementation
3. Fix nullability warnings in integration tests

## Recommendation

Focus on completing the database infrastructure implementation and then address test issues as part of each vertical slice implementation.
