# Health Tracker Database Infrastructure Implementation

## Overview

The Health Tracker application uses SQLite database infrastructure to store weigh-ins and runs data. This document summarizes the implementation of the database infrastructure for Vertical Slice 1.

## Implemented Components

1. **Database Service Interface**
   - `IDatabaseService` defines methods for:
     - Database initialization and table creation
     - Health checks
     - CRUD operations
     - Statistics retrieval

2. **Database Service Implementation**
   - `DatabaseService` implements database operations using Dapper and SQLite
   - Creates tables for weighins and runs with constraints
   - Handles configuration from environment variables or appsettings.json
   - Includes error handling and logging

3. **Health Service Integration**
   - Updated `HealthService` to use the database service for real statistics
   - Returns actual database counts for the `/about` endpoint

4. **API Endpoints**
   - Added `/health` endpoint to check database connectivity
   - Updated `/about` endpoint to return real database statistics

5. **Docker Support**
   - Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerization
   - Volume mapping for database persistence
   - Environment variables for configuration

6. **Build Automation**
   - PowerShell build script with targets for Docker operations
   - Commands for building, testing, and managing containers

7. **Tests**
   - Unit tests for database service functionality
   - Integration tests with in-memory SQLite
   - Health endpoint tests

## Configuration Options

Database connection can be configured through:
1. Environment variable: `HEALTH_TRACKER_DB_PATH`
2. Connection string in appsettings.json
3. Default fallback path

## Docker Usage

The Docker container runs the API on port 50000 and stores the SQLite database in a persistent volume.

## Next Steps

1. Complete the endpoint implementation for:
   - `POST /weight` for logging weigh-ins
   - `GET /weight/last/{count}` for retrieving weigh-in history
   - `POST /run` for logging runs
   - `GET /run/last/{count}` for retrieving run history

2. Extend the database service with specific operations for these endpoints

3. Add validation rules for data input
